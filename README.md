# NetDeflect

**NetDeflect** is an easy to use real-time DDoS detection and mitigation tool for Linux-based systems. It captures, analyzes, and classifies traffic in real-time, blocks malicious IPs based on attack signatures, provides live metrics and Discord webhook alerts.

---

### ‚ú® Features

- üìä **Live Network Monitoring**: Real-time PPS, MB/s, and CPU tracking.
- üö® **Automated Detection**: Detects DDoS attacks using known protocol signatures and flags.
- üî• **Auto-Mitigation**: Blocks offending IPs using `iptables`, `ipset`, `ufw`, or blackhole routing.
- üîç **Traffic Analysis**: Uses `tcpdump` and `tshark` to capture and inspect attack patterns.
- üìÅ **Organized Reports**: Stores pcap captures and analysis logs per incident.
- üì° **Discord Webhook Support**: Sends alerts with attack stats and summaries.
- üîÑ **Self-Updating Checker**: Notifies you when a new version is available on GitHub.

---

### üõ† Requirements

- Linux (Debian-based preferred)
- Python 3
- Packages `tcpdump`, `tshark`
- Firewall `iptables`, `ipset` (optional)
- PIP `psutil`, `requests`

---

### üöÄ Installation
(as root)

Ideally in a screen or tmux
```bash
apt install tcpdump tshark -y

git clone https://github.com/0vm/NetDeflect
cd NetDeflect

pip install psutil requests

python3 netdeflect.py
```
### On first use, you will need to run `netdeflect.py` several times to complete setup.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

On first run, a `settings.ini` file and a `notification_template.json` will be created with defaults.

Your Discord webhook should be added to the `settings.ini` file.

The `notification_template.json` defines the Discord embed layout and can be fully customized.

Note: It's recommended to keep `enable_fallback_blocking` set to `False` to reduce the risk of false positives.

### üß† Attack Vector Matching

Attack signatures are loaded from `methods.json` and include detection for:

#### Reflection & Amplification Attacks

- TeamSpeak, Jenkins, Citrix, ARD, Plex, DVR, FiveM, Lantronix Reflections  
- BitTorrent Reflection  
- Apple serialnumberd Reflection  
- OpenVPN, DTLS, OpenAFS Reflection  
- vxWorks, Digiman, Crestron Reflection  
- XDMCP, IPMI Reflection

- ArmA Reflection (Ports 2302/2303)  
- TeamSpeak Status Flood  
- VSE (Valve Source Engine) Flood  
- FiveM Reflection  

---

#### TCP-Based Reflection Attacks

Mimic or abuse standard TCP-based services:

### üì¶ Output Structure

```
netdeflect.py
settings.ini
notification_template.json
./application_data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ captures/           ‚Üê Raw .pcap traffic captures
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ips/       ‚Üê IPs identified during attacks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ attack_analysis/    ‚Üê Plaintext reports
```

### üì¢ Notification Example

Sends alerts to Discord with information like:

- PPS & MBps before mitigation
- Blocked IP count
- Attack vector
- Mitigation status
